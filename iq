* ) why we need docker?
Problem:
========
* An application works in developer's laptop but not in testing or production. This is due to difference in computing environment between Dev,Stage and Prod. 
* I want a new technology stack in one of my module on one of my service.

Solution:
=========
* Some type of applications become easier to build and maintain when they are broken down into smaller composable pieces which work together.
* Each component is developed separately and the application is then simply the sum of its constituent components.
* I want a new technology stack in one of my module on one of my service so i can easily do that because the dependency concerns will be very less when compared to the application as a whole apart from that the third reason is if any of my module or any of my service goes down my whole application remains largely unaffected.
