* ) why we need docker?
Problem:
========
* An application works in developer's laptop but not in testing or production. This is due to difference in computing environment between Dev,Stage and Prod. 
* I want a new technology stack in one of my module on one of my service.
* Developing an application requires several of microservices in one machine.so if you are starting five of those services you require five VMs on that machine.  

Solution:
=========
* Some type of applications become easier to build and maintain when they are broken down into smaller composable pieces which work together.
* Each component is developed separately and the application is then simply the sum of its constituent components.
* I want a new technology stack in one of my module on one of my service so i can easily do that because the dependency concerns will be very less when compared to the application as a whole apart from that the third reason is if any of my module or any of my service goes down my whole application remains largely unaffected.

how docker is solving these problems :
======================================
you can run several microservices in the same VM by running various docker containers for each microservice. 
you don't need to pre allocate any RAM or any disk space so it will take the RAM and disk space according to the requirement of applications
Run docker containers when a virtual machine is that you want to segregate it from the rest of the host machine you want to encapsulate that separately in a virtual machine
Docker containers can be used throughout the whole lifecycle in order to provide consistent computing environment so the same env will be present in dev,test and prod.

what is docker?
================
Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy and run applications by using containers.
Docker containers are lightweight alternatives to virtual machines and it uses the host OS.

what is docker file?
====================
docker file builds a docker image and that image contains all the project's code. 
you can run that image to create as many docker containers as you want.
then that image can be uploaded on docker hub,from docker hub any one can pull the image and build a container.

what is docker hub?
====================
docker hub is basically a cloud hosted service provided by docker 

what is docker DTR?
===================
DTR(Docker trusted registry)
It stores the docker images
